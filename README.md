# U.S. National Parks

A visual representation of the U.S. National Parks that we’ve visited.

## Poster sets

I’m using the Anderson Design Group style currently, but it’d be easy to swap in an alternative poster set if you prefer.

### [Anderson Design Group](https://www.andersondesigngroupstore.com/a/collections/60-american-national-parks)

Not WPA style whatsoever:

> Inspired by the iconic WPA-commissioned artwork of the early 1900s, our National Park series is meant to conjure nostalgia through design, to celebrate our American heritage and the gift of unbridled nature with pencil, brush, and stylus.
>
> We're finishing what the WPA began, hand-illustrating original travel designs for all 59 National Parks (with new angles and perspectives added all the time)

### [Rob Decker](https://www.national-park-posters.com/product-category/posters/)

In the style of WPA, but trying to modernize as opposed to merely fill-in the gaps:

> Inspired by the iconic WPA artwork of the 1930s and 40s. As a photographer, artist and craftsman, I am passionate about preserving the nostalgic style of the WPA-era.
>
> I’m picking up where the masters from that time left off, building on what they began to create a whole new body of National Park poster art for our generation.

### [Ranger Doug](http://www.rangerdoug.com/posters)

Trying to directly augment the existing posters with ones that percectly match the style:

> Most of the classic National Parks posters you've seen were probably imitations created by Doug to mimic the originals or original works he himself created for the parks that didn't get WPA posters before World War II, when the posters faded out of import and disappeared into boxes and desk drawers.

Another modern take.
